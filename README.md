# Memory Game Project

This is a simple matching game made as a Udacity nanodegree project.

## How to play

Go to https://yolantab.github.io/memorygame/  or download repository and open index.html file in your browser. Find two identical symbols by clicking on cards. Matching cards stay opened when paired, if they don't match they stay hidden. When you find all pairs, you win. 

The final score depends on how much moves you made.

* less than 16 moves &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;
* more than 16 and less than 30 &#9733; &#9733;
* 30 moves and more &#9733;
